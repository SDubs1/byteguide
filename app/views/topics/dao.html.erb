<h3>What is a DAO?</h3>

  <p><strong>DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</strong>) are online communities where decisions are made through community votes. Basic criteria for participation is based on ownership of tokens or NFTs. Some DAOs enable direct voting on proposals, while others enable token holders to delegate their votes to a trusted DAO representative.</p>

<h4>Examples of DAOs</h4>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>DAO</th>
      <th>Function</th>
      <th>Features/Developments</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maker</td>
      <td>Decentralized lending platform.</td>
      <td>Users deposit assets and receive “stable coins”, DAI, as collateral. Notable features include the use of smart contracts to maintain stability, the MKR token for governance and risk management, and the concept of "Vaults" for collateral management.</td>
      <td>MakerDAO is one of the oldest DAOs on Ethereum blockchain. System reliance on collateral value stability and potential vulnerabilities in the underlying assets can impact the stability of the DAI token.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Optimism</td>
      <td>Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.</td>
      <td>Designed to improve the network's scalability and reduce transaction fees. Has potential to alleviate scalability concerns and has gained attention for its role in enhancing the usability of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (or dApps).</td>
      <td>Community values aim toward adoption, onboarding, and public goods. Coinbase, the largest US exchange, recently released its own blockchain developed with Optimism substack.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gitcoin</td>
      <td>Crowdfunding platform for Web3 startups and public goods.</td>
      <td>Funds are raised with quadratic funding, which provides a large impact from user donations. Gitcoin additionally has built its own Web3 technologies, like Gitcoin passport, a solution for proving authenticity of Web3 users and preventing spam and manipulation from bots and alt-accounts.</td>
      <td>Gitcoin has drawn criticism after a backlash over their announced collaboration with Shell, who will help fund the matching pools for crowdfunding of climate research projects in the Gitcoin Grants Program.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Ethereum Name Services (ENS)</td>
      <td>Domain name service for Ethereum.</td>
      <td>Enables users to replace complex hexadecimal addresses with human-readable domain names, making it easier for users to interact with blockchain applications.</td>
      <td>Domain names can prove useful in circumventing phishing and clipboard hijacking attacks. Like tradition web domain names, ENS domains can be sold or traded on the open market.</td>

<h4>DAO Governance</h4>
  <h5>Pros</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Participant responses are immutable and verifiable.
        <ul>
          <li>Users can vote for, against, or abstain from proposals. Responses are recorded on the blockchain.</li>
          <li>While blockchain voting is not limited to the scope of DAO participation, vote immutability has the potential to demonstrate transparency and legitimacy of results.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Users are empowered to have an impact on governance and finance.
        <ul>
          <li>This gives opportunities for communities to have a direct impact on important decisions without a middleman or central authority.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Participants maintain autonomy over their votes.
        <ul>
          <li>Sole voting power lies with the user.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <br>

  <h5>Cons</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Wealth buys influence
        <ul>
          <li>Influence through wealth accumulation creates a "digital plutocracy", where the wealthiest participants have disproportionate influence.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Human Nature
        <ul>
          <li>Users are often incentivized to always vote in their own financial interests, stalling progress.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Development Team Centralization
        <ul>
          <li>DAO development teams can still disregard the will of the community.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <br>

  <h5>Challenges</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>"Worthless governance tokens"
        <ul>
          <li>DAO tokens are commonly used for raising funds for projects through retail investors. Average token price performances resemble “pump and dump” trends, which has drawn skepticism and critique in and outside of the Web 3 space.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sybil attacks
        <ul>
          <li>Community members creating multiple "sock puppet" accounts to manipulate votes or engage in other fraudulent activity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Voter privacy
        <ul>
          <li>While there could be some public benefit to voting transparency, there are other cases where the privacy of an individual's vote should also be protected. In the current state of DAOs, all user voting data is publicly available.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <br>

  <h5>Solutions</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Account abstraction for user privacy and sybil resistance
        <ul>
          <li>User authenticity and individuality can be verified by using technologies like zero knowledge proofs, which can prove that users match certain criteria for voting eligibility, while not revealing their identity to the public.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Smart Contract Security audits
        <ul>
          <li>Smart contract security audits enhance both DAOs and the broader Web3 ecosystem by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in code. For DAOs, audits bolster governance integrity, preventing attacks and ensuring token-holder interests.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <br>

  <h5>DAOs gone wrong</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Tornado Cash DAO exploit
        <ul>
          <li>Tornado Cash DAO suffered a hack where an attacker exploited a proposal, taking control of the project and draining tokens.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Arbitrum team's management of funds
        <ul>
          <li>Arbitrum team preemptively spent tokens before the results of a DAO vote where the community rejected the spending of $1 billion worth of ARB tokens.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>"The DAO hack"
        <ul>
          <li>The Ethereum DAO hack involved an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities to drain a significant amount of Ether from the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This incident led to a contentious debate within the Ethereum community, resulting in a contentious hard fork to reverse the hack and recover the stolen funds.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
