  <h3>What are smart contracts??</h3>

    <p>Ah, smart contracts! They're like the fusion of money and contracts in the digital realm. Picture this: NFTs and tokens themselves are smart contracts, supercharged with special powers.</p>

    <p>They're like digital entities that hold value and come with a set of rules embedded in their code. Just like money, they can be traded, bought, and sold. But unlike traditional contracts, they automatically enforce the terms written in their code without relying on a middleman.</p>

    <p>It's like having your very own digital genie that grants your wishes, except instead of wishes, it handles transactions, ownership, and so much more.</p>

    <p>So, with smart contracts, you get the best of both worlds: the security and transparency of the blockchain combined with the functionality of contracts.</p>

  <%# <p>Ah, smart contracts! They're like the lovechild of money and contracts, all wrapped up in a neat blockchain package.

    These digital wonders are computer programs that automatically execute the terms of an agreement.

    And guess what? NFTs and tokens themselves are smart contracts too!

    It's like having money that knows how to follow rules and contracts that can handle transactions.

    So when you see those NFTs and tokens flying around, just remember that they're not just any old digital doodads, they're smart contracts making magic happen on the blockchain.

    It's contract time, baby!
