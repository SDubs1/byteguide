<h1>What are tokens?</h1>
<p>Tokens are cryptocurrencies that exist on the blockchain.

  Unlike digital banking, users don’t require a bank account to transact.

  Most cryptocurrencies are only designed for spending and trading.

  Tokens on Web 3 have a more complex design, where they can have their own programmable functions.</p>

<h4>There are three types of tokens on Ethereum:</h4>
<p><strong>Ether (ETH)</strong> is the token that powers the network by running a fee infrastructure which funds the security of the network.

<strong>Fungible</strong> tokens have a variety of functions and are most commonly used for trading.

The most popular of these tokens are stable coins, which represent a 1-to-1 value of real world currency.

<strong>NFTs</strong> have uniqueness and can represent artwork, contracts, or other digital items.

All tokens can have their own programmable functions built in, which are like internal rules that allow the tokens to have their own unique features.</p>



<h2>WTF?</h2>
<p>NFTs can make it possible to merge money, art, and contracts into one token! Each token has its own long string of random characters that makes it uniquely identifiable, just like addresses.

NFTs also have their own programmability, which can give them other features.</p>
