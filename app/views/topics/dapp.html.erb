  <h3>What are dApps?</h3>
  <p>"dApp" is short for "decentralized app". dApps work a lot like normal apps, except that instead of being controlled by a single entity or company, a dApp runs on a blockchain.</p>

    <p>It's like a digital playground where users can interact with each other and the app itself without relying on a central authority. Think of it as a community-driven app where everyone has a say and no one holds all the power.</p>

    <p>It's all about democratizing the digital world and giving users more control over their own data and experiences.</p>


  <%# <p>Alright, let's talk about dApps, the rebel apps of the digital realm!

  They're like regular apps, but they break free from the clutches of big corporations and dance to their own decentralized tunes.

  Imagine a virtual party where everyone can join, mingle, and have a blast without being bossed around by a single app dictator.

  It's like a wild west of app awesomeness, where the power is in the hands of the people.

  So put on your digital boots, partner, and get ready to explore the untamed frontier of dApps! Yeehaw! %>
