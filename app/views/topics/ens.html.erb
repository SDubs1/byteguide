<p>ENS, short for Ethereum Name Service, is like a fancy phone book for the blockchain.

  Instead of using those crazy hexadecimal strings to interact with blockchain addresses, you can use human-readable names, like a web domain name. Just like owning a domain name gives you control over a website, owning an ENS name gives you control over your blockchain address.

  It's like having a digital identity that's unique and easy to remember, and yes, ENS names are themselves NFTs, which means they can be bought, sold, and owned just like any other digital asset.</p>
