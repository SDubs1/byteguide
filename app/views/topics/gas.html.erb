<h4>What is gas?</h4>
<p>Gas is like the fuel that powers the Ethereum network. It's a little something you pay whenever you want to perform a transaction or run a smart contract on the blockchain. Think of it as the cost of doing business in the digital realm, ensuring that the network stays secure and operational. The more complex or resource-intensive your transaction is, the more gas you'll need to pay. So, make sure you have enough gas in your digital tank before you hit the road!</p>


 <%# Gas is like the magic potion that makes Ethereum go vroom! It's the secret sauce that keeps the blockchain engine running smoothly. When you want to do stuff on Ethereum, like sending tokens or making smart contracts do their thing, you gotta pay up some gas. It's like giving a little tip to the blockchain miners who do all the heavy lifting. Just make sure you don't run out of gas, or your transaction might sputter and stall. Keep those digital wheels rolling!</p> %>
