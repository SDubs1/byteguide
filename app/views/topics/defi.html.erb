<h3>What is DeFi?</h3>
  <p>DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is like traditional finance, but without intermediaries. It's a whole new way of doing financial stuff using blockchain technology. Instead of relying on banks or other middlemen, DeFi cuts out the middleman and lets you directly interact with financial services using smart contracts.</p>
  <p>You can lend, borrow, trade, invest, and more, all without the need for a traditional financial institution. It's like taking control of your financial destiny and saying, "Hey, banks, I can do this on my own!"</p>

  <%# <p>Alright, hold onto your hats, because DeFi is like diving into a financial wonderland where money wears a tuxedo and parties with smart contracts.
    Picture this: you step into a virtual world where banks are replaced by unicorns and Wall Street is a funky dance floor.
    In this magical realm, you can lend your digital dough, borrow some crypto coins, and trade like a wizard of finance.
    It's like being in a twisted dream where money grows on blockchain trees and piggy banks are actually literal pigs.
    So grab your digital wallet and get ready for a wild ride through the DeFi carnival! Just don't forget to bring your sense of humor and a healthy dose of caution, because things can get wonderfully weird in this financial wonderland!</p> %>
