<h2>What is a wallet?</h2>
<p>Think of a wallet as like a master account where you can manage all of your digital assets and NFTs. A user can manage multiple addresses (accounts) with their wallet.</p>
<br>

<h3>WTF?</h3>
<p>Wallets function just like accounts on popular websites. Users can log into their wallet and view all of their crypto accounts, like a dash board. Because the account exists on the blockchain, a decentralized public network, the user is the sole owner of the account: that means the user is the sole owner of all assets and the sole controller of all transactions of the account, unlike conventional applications such as banks or social media companies.</p>
<br>

<h2>What is an address?</h2>

<p>A wallet can generate addresses for users to deposit funds. Each address functions as its own individual account and every address is identified by a long and unique string of random characters.</p>
<br>

<h3>WTF?</h3>
<p>An address functions as a unique way of identifying your account as it is a very long string of numbers that are randomly generated. The odds of generating an identical account are XXX. Keep in mind that an address and wallet are not the same thing, as your wallet can manage multiple addresses.</p>

<h2>Transacting:</h2>
<p>Sending funds to an address functions exactly like modern digital banking in many countries. To send or receive funds, simply copy and paste the unique address number of the recipient (like an IBAN number).</p>
<br>

<h3>WTF?</h3>
<p>Transactions to and from an address on the blockchain function very much like shipping a package to a physical address:</p>
<p>1. The sender ships a package to a physical address. <br>
(The user sends funds to an Ethereum address) <br><br>
2. A fee is charged for shipping and handling costs <br>
(A fee is charged for block space.*) <br><br>
3. The shipping data is publicly tracked <br>
(The data of the transaction amount, date, time, sender, and receiver are public and are permanently stored in “blocks”.) <br><br>
*block space on the most trusted blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, is not cheap. Learn more about transaction fees.</p>

<h4>Comparing Wallets</h4>
<p>Every wallet comes with pros and cons. On one hand, we would recommend wallets like Coinbase wallet to new users because it is the beginner-friendly and offers a range of features. On the other hand, software wallets like Coinbase wallet inherit security vulnerabilities that could result in loss of user funds.</p>
<p>It's very important for new users to consider their options and risks when selecting a wallet. As a general best practice, we recommend NOT to store large amounts of money using with anything but a hardware wallet!</p>
<p>ELI5: Software wallets are hackable because your secret key is online. Hardware wallets are not hackable, because the secret key is only on the device.</p>



<h2>What is a wallet?</h2>

It's a powerful tool that empowers you to navigate the decentralized landscape with confidence and autonomy.</p>
<br>
<h2>What is an address?</h2>
<p>An address is like your virtual GPS coordinates, pinpointing your location in the vast blockchain universe.

Just like receiving a care package from a distant galaxy, an address ensures that your crypto goodies find their way to you in the vastness of the blockchain cosmos.</p>
<br>
<h3>WTF?</h3>
<p>Imagine an address as your digital home, a place where your crypto transactions find their way. It's like having a personal mailbox in the blockchain neighborhood.

It's a seamless process that allows you to participate in the global economy of digital assets.</p>
<br>
<h3>WTF?</h3>
<p>Transacting with cryptocurrencies is like conducting a digital dance, where you can gracefully move your funds across the blockchain stage. It's like extending a virtual high-five to someone in a different part of the world, knowing that the transaction is secure, transparent, and recorded in the shared ledger of the blockchain. It's a fascinating ballet of technology and finance that opens up new possibilities for borderless transactions and financial empowerment.</p>
