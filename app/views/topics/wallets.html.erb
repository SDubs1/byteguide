  <h3>What is a wallet?</h3>
  <p>Think of a wallet as like a master account where you can manage all of your digital assets and NFTs. A user can manage multiple addresses (accounts) with their wallet.</p>
  <br>

  <%# <h3>WTF?</h3>
  <p>Wallets function just like accounts on popular websites. Users can log into their wallet and view all of their crypto accounts, like a dash board. Because the account exists on the blockchain, a decentralized public network, the user is the sole owner of the account: that means the user is the sole owner of all assets and the sole controller of all transactions of the account, unlike conventional applications such as banks or social media companies.</p>

  <h3>Comparing Wallets</h3>
    <p>Every wallet comes with pros and cons. On one hand, we would recommend wallets like Coinbase wallet to new users because it is the beginner-friendly and offers a range of features. On the other hand, software wallets like Coinbase wallet inherit security vulnerabilities that could result in loss of user funds.</p>
    <p>It's very important for new users to consider their options and risks when selecting a wallet. As a general best practice, we recommend NOT to store large amounts of money using with anything but a hardware wallet!</p>
    <p>ELI5: Software wallets are hackable because your secret key is online. Hardware wallets are not hackable, because the secret key is only on the device.</p>

  <%# <h2>What is a wallet?</h2>
  <p>A wallet is like a magical pouch that holds all your digital treasures, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It's your personal vault where you can manage and keep track of your valuable assets. You can think of it as a Swiss army knife for the digital world.</p>
  <h3>WTF?</h3>
  <p>Think of a wallet as your virtual safe, where you keep your digital treasures. It's your own private fortress, accessible only to you, that holds the keys to your crypto kingdom. With a wallet, you become the master of your financial destiny, free from the constraints of traditional banks or intermediaries. It's a powerful tool that empowers you to navigate the decentralized landscape with confidence and autonomy.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What is an address?</h2>
  <p>An address is like your virtual GPS coordinates, pinpointing your location in the vast blockchain universe. It's a code that speaks the language of the blockchain, guiding the flow of digital riches to your doorstep. Just like receiving a care package from a distant galaxy, an address ensures that your crypto goodies find their way to you in the vastness of the blockchain cosmos.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>WTF?</h3>
  <p>Imagine an address as your digital home, a place where your crypto transactions find their way. It's like having a personal mailbox in the blockchain neighborhood. Just as your home address ensures that your mail reaches you, your unique blockchain address ensures that your digital funds and assets end up in the right hands. It's a virtual passport that opens doors to the exciting world of decentralized finance.</p>

  <h2>Transacting:</h2>
  <p>When it comes to transacting with cryptocurrencies, it's like engaging in a digital exchange. You can securely send and receive funds, just like having a virtual handshake with someone across the blockchain. It's a seamless process that allows you to participate in the global economy of digital assets.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>WTF?</h3>
  <p>Transacting with cryptocurrencies is like conducting a digital dance, where you can gracefully move your funds across the blockchain stage. It's like extending a virtual high-five to someone in a different part of the world, knowing that the transaction is secure, transparent, and recorded in the shared ledger of the blockchain. It's a fascinating ballet of technology and finance that opens up new possibilities for borderless transactions and financial empowerment.</p>

  <h4>Comparing Wallets</h4>
  <p>Choosing a wallet is like selecting the perfect tool for your crypto journey. Just as different tools have their unique features and purposes, wallets come in various forms with their own strengths and advantages.

  <p>ELI5: Wallets are like your digital companions, each with its own set of superpowers. Some are user-friendly sidekicks, while others are fortified fortresses. Choose wisely based on your needs and keep your crypto assets safe!</p> %>
