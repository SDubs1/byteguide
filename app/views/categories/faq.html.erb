    <h1>How do I keep my crypto safe?</h1>
  <p>Keeping your crypto safe is essential, and here are three key steps to protect it:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use a hardware wallet:</strong> A hardware wallet is a special device that securely stores your crypto offline. It keeps your private keys isolated from the internet, making it highly resistant to hacking attempts.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Activate 2FA wherever possible. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide a second verification code, usually from your mobile device, along with your password when accessing your crypto accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets:</strong> Multi-sig wallets require multiple signatures to authorize transactions. It means that more than one person needs to approve a transaction, adding an extra layer of security against unauthorized access.</li>
  </ul>
